# screen-keylogger-advanced
this was a fun experiment i have been working on. it is intended for educational purposes only.

Basically, the code is keylogging, and every 60 seconds it will screenshot log.
after collecting the data, it will send the data to a server.
I am working on a GUI application where the user would be able to view data cleanly.
